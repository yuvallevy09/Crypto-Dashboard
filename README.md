# Crypto-Dashboard
A web app that serves as a personalized crypto investor dashboard. The app gets to know the user through a short onboarding quiz and then shows daily AI-curated content tailored to their interests. Users can give feedback (thumbs up/down) to help improve future recommendations. A fun meme is also shown dynamically each time the dashboard updates.
